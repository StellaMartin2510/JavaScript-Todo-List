# JavaScript-Todo-List

This project is part of my Web Development Bootcamp learning journey. It's a basic to-do list application implemented in JavaScript.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open index.html in your web browser.
3. Follow the prompts to interact with the to-do list (e.g., add new tasks, list tasks, delete tasks).

## Learning Notes

I created this project to practice JavaScript and reinforce the concepts learned during my Web Development Bootcamp. Feel free to explore the code and provide any feedback or suggestions!
